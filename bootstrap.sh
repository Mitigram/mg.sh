  # Introspect by asking which file descriptors the current process has opened.
  # This is an evolution of https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/351658 and works as
  # follows:
  # 1. lsof is called to list out open files. lsof will have different
  #    results/outputs depending on the shell used. For example, when using
  #    busybox, there are few built-ins.
  # 2. Remove the \0 to be able to understand the result as text
  # 3. Transform somewhat the output of lsof on "normal" distros/shell to
  #    something that partly resembles lsof on busybox, i.e. file descritor id,
  #    followed by space, followed by file spec.
  # 4. Remove irrelevant stuff, these have a tendency to happen after the file
  #    that we are looking for. This is because the pipe implementing this is
  #    active, so binaries, devices, etc. will be opened when it runs in order
  #    to implement it. So we remove /dev references, pipe: (busybox), and all
  #    references to the binaries used when implementing the pipe itself.
  # 5. The file we are looking for is the last whitespace separated field of the
  #    last line.

  #    another process to filter out and reason about.
